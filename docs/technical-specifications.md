## System Architecture Overview

The PiiComm Service Management System (PSMS) is designed as a multi-tier architecture, comprising the following layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: A web-based user interface built with responsive design principles to ensure accessibility across devices.
- **Application Layer**: A set of microservices managing core business logic, developed using RESTful APIs to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- **Data Layer**: A centralized database system ensuring data integrity and availability for all services.

## Technology Stack Details

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **API Management**: Swagger, Postman for API documentation and testing
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions

## Database Schema and Relationships

The system employs a relational database schema, with the following key tables and relationships:

- **Users**: Stores user credentials and profiles
- **Services**: Catalog of services managed by PSMS
- **Tickets**: Records of service requests and incidents
- **Assignments**: Linking services to users or teams
- **Logs**: Audit trails for user actions and system events

### Relationships

- **One-to-Many**: Users to Tickets
- **Many-to-Many**: Users to Services via Assignments
- **One-to-Many**: Services to Tickets

## Security Specifications

- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 for secure access control
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users have appropriate permissions
- **Data Encryption**: TLS 1.2+ for data in transit, AES-256 for data at rest
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of user activities for compliance
- **Security Testing**: Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing

## Performance Requirements

- **Response Time**: API requests should be processed within 200ms for 95% of requests
- **Throughput**: Capable of handling up to 10,000 concurrent users
- **Latency**: End-to-end latency should not exceed 300ms

## Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use of Kubernetes to add/remove service instances based on load
- **Load Balancing**: NGINX or HAProxy to distribute traffic efficiently
- **Database Sharding**: Partitioning the database to enhance performance and manage large datasets

## Integration Capabilities

- **RESTful APIs**: Exposed endpoints for third-party integration
- **Webhook Support**: Real-time event notifications
- **Data Import/Export**: JSON, CSV format support for data interoperability
- **Third-party Services**: Integration with CRM systems, payment gateways, and messaging services

## Deployment Architecture

- **Environment**: Development, Staging, and Production environments
- **Infrastructure**: Hosted on AWS, leveraging services like EC2, RDS, and S3
- **Container Management**: Kubernetes for orchestrating containers across environments
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible for automated environment setup and configuration

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Monitoring Tools**: Prometheus and Grafana for real-time system performance monitoring
- **Logging Framework**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging
- **Alerting**: Configured alerts via PagerDuty for critical system events
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry for capturing and managing application exceptions
